## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
This portfolio is a static site, meaning it primarily serves pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly to the browser. Content is dynamically injected on the client-side using JavaScript from local JSON files, eliminating the need for a traditional backend database. The architecture emphasizes robust deployment automation.
